# 100-Days-of-Code
This is only related to problem solving using Data Structure &amp; Algorithms, taking questions from various 
site like **Leetcode, Hackerrank, Codechef, Codeforces**. (*This is not related to competitive programming*).
Language can be Cplusplus or Python, it depends on mindset. But Since I'm a data scientist, therefore it'll mostly be python.

### Day 1: Computing sqrt of number using binary search approach with precision. [Leetcode-link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)
### Day 2: Computing fibonacci numbers using dynamic programming in python. [Leetcode-link](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)
### Day 3: Sort the array containg 1,2,3 only using three pointers approach. [Leetcode-link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)
